# Async Comprehension

**`yield`**

In Python, `yield` is used in the context of a generator to produce a sequence of values over time, rather than computing them all at once and sending them back. This allows the function to pause and resume its execution, making it very memory-efficient for iterating over large data sets or performing asynchronous operations.

When used in an `async` function, `yield` isn't directly applicable because `async` functions and `async` generators have a different mechanism for producing values. Instead, you use `yield` in an `async` generator to create an asynchronous iterator. Here's a quick overview of how it works:

### Regular Generators

In a regular generator function, you use `yield` to produce values one at a time:

```python
def count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        yield count
        count += 1
```

### Asynchronous Generators

In an `async` generator function, you use `yield` to produce values in an asynchronous context:

```python
async def async_count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an async operation
        yield count
        count += 1
```

### Using Asynchronous Generators

To use an asynchronous generator, you iterate over it with `async for`:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    async for number in async_count_up_to(5):
        print(number)

asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, the `async_count_up_to` function is an asynchronous generator that yields values after waiting asynchronously. The `async for` loop handles the asynchronous iteration.

So, `yield` in an asynchronous generator works similarly to its use in a regular generator but is designed to be used with asynchronous code, allowing for non-blocking operations.

**`List Comprehension`**

Definition: A concise way to create lists using a single line of code.
Example:
```
numbers = [x * 2 for x in range(10)]
# Result: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
```

**`Why the Runtime is Roughly 10 Seconds`**

The total runtime of roughly 10 seconds can be explained by the behavior of the async_comprehension coroutine, which involves:

async_comprehension: This coroutine uses an asynchronous comprehension to collect 10 random numbers from async_generator, which itself yields values with a 1-second delay between each.

Execution Time: Each call to async_comprehension involves waiting for 10 seconds (1 second per yield from async_generator for 10 yields).

When running four instances of async_comprehension in parallel, the asyncio.gather function schedules all four coroutines to run concurrently. Therefore, while each individual coroutine takes around 10 seconds to complete, they all run simultaneously. Thus, the total runtime for executing all four coroutines in parallel is roughly 10 seconds, as the operations overlap and do not stack up sequentially.
